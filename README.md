# GuessTheFlag
Guess the flag repository

I have been following the #100daysofswift challenge. 
On the second project, we worked on a simple ‘Guess The Flag’ iOS quiz game. 
Though the application is simple, it has helped grasp core iOS development concepts that are used in developing these applications.
Some of the concepts learnt during the completion of #project1 include;

- Interface Builder
- Auto Layouts
- Outlets
- @2x and @3x
- Asset Catalogs
- UIButton
- CA Layer
- UIColor
- Random Numbers
- Actions
- UIAlertController

I also got to complete the challenge where I displayed the counter on the navigation bar, and added a counter to count to ten guesses
